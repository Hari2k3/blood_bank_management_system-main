## Technologies Used

- **React:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework for styling the application.
- **Flask:** A Python web framework used for the server-side development.

## Database Schema

The app uses two tables in the MySQL database:

### Hospital Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE hospital (
    hospital_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    hospital_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
);
```

### Donor Table


```sql
CREATE TABLE donor (
    donor_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    phone VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
    blood_group VARCHAR(5) NOT NULL
